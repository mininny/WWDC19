 # Closing up...
 
 In this playground we learned about 3D World with ARKit, 2D world with SpriteKit, and various capabilities they offer.
 
 Also, we learned about the detrimental effects of electronic wastes.
 
 However, why does it really matter? Why should we care about our E-Wastes and what we should do help it?
 
 That's because it's part of our humanity, and it's **our** responsibility to improve our world!
 
 # CongratulationsðŸŽ‰
 You made it through this playground!
 I know you have a lot more applications to look over, and I want to tell you something.
 
 Smile:)
 
 In this page, we're using AVFoundation's photo capture, and CoreImage to detect faces. When the CoreImage locates your face, you will see on the top label, and if you smile, a label will appear!
 
 # Thank you, and I hope to see you at WWDC19!
