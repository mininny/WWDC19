		<dict>
			<key>Title</key>
			<string>Diffuse</string>
			<key>Definition</key>

		<dict>
			<key>Title</key>
			<string>SKEmitterNode</string>
			<key>Definition</key>
			<string>SKEmitterNode is a node that automatically creates and renders small particle sprites. Emitter nodes are often used to create smoke, fire, sparks, and other particle effects.</string>

			<key>Title</key>
			<string>SKNode</string>
			<key>Definition</key>
			<string>SKNode is the base class of all SpriteKit nodes. It provides base properties for its subclasses, such as SKShapeNode, SKSpriteNode, SKEmitterNode.</string>

		<key>SKView</key>
		<dict>
			<key>Title</key>
			<string>SKView</string>
			<key>Definition</key>
			<string>SKView is a view subclass that renders a SpriteKit scene. When a scene is presented by the view, it alternates between running its simulation (which animates the content) and rendering the content for display.</string>

		<key>SKScene</key>
		<dict>
			<key>Title</key>
			<string>SKScene</string>
			<key>Definition</key>
			<string>SKScene organizes all of the active SpriteKit content. It provides content that the scene animates and renders for display.</string>
		</dict>

			<key>Title</key>
			<string>SpriteKit</string>
			<key>Definition</key>
			<string>SpriteKit is a general-purpose framework for drawing shapes, particles, text, images, and video in two dimensions. It utilizes Metal to achieve high-performance rendering, and offers diverse set of features such as lighting, physics, animations, and so much more.</string>

		<dict>
			<key>Title</key>
			<string>SCNPhysicsBody</string>
			<key>Definition</key>
			<string>SCNPhysicsBody are physics simulation atrributes attached to a scene node. It performs physics calculations on physics bodies which include gravity, friction, and collision with other bodies. You can also apply your own force and impulses to a body.  </string>

		<key>FeaturePoint</key>
		<dict>
			<key>Definition</key>
			<string>Feature Points represent parts of the camera image likely to be part of a real-world surface. </string>
			<key>Title</key>
			<string>Feature Point</string>
		</dict>
		<key>HitTest</key>
		<dict>
			<key>Definition</key>
			<string>Hit Test searches for real-world objects or surfaces detected through the AR session. A 2D point in the view&apos;s coordinate system can refer to any point along a 3D line that starts at the device camera and extends in a direction determined by the device orientation and camera projection. This method searches along that line, returning all objects that intersect it in order of distance from the camera.</string>

		</dict>
		<key>Anchor</key>
		<dict>
			<key>Definition</key>
			<string>Anchors are used in AR Session to track static positions and orientations of real or virtual objects relative to the camera. </string>
